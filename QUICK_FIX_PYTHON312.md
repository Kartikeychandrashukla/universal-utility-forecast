# ðŸ”¥ QUICK FIX for Python 3.12

## âš¡ The Problem
You're getting a `pkgutil.ImpImporter` error because some packages don't work with Python 3.12 yet.

## âœ… The Solution (Choose One)

### Option 1: Use the Installation Script (EASIEST)
**Windows:**
```bash
install_python312.bat
```

Just double-click the file or run it in terminal!

### Option 2: Install Minimal Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
```

### Option 3: Install Core Packages Only
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly scikit-learn python-dotenv pyyaml
```

### Option 4: Install One by One
```bash
pip install streamlit
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install plotly
pip install scikit-learn
```

## ðŸš€ After Installation

Run the dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What Works

âœ… **EVERYTHING except ARIMA and Prophet forecasting:**
- Data upload âœ…
- Data validation âœ…
- Utility detection âœ…
- **Simple Moving Average forecasting** âœ…
- Monte Carlo valuation âœ…
- Risk metrics âœ…
- Visualizations âœ…
- Export to CSV/JSON âœ…

## ðŸ’¡ Forecasting Tip

When you get to the Forecast page:
1. Set your forecast horizon (e.g., 90 days)
2. **Select "Simple Moving Average"** from the model dropdown
3. Click "Generate Forecast"
4. Works perfectly! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ“Š Simple Moving Average is Actually Great

Don't worry about missing ARIMA/Prophet:
- Simple MA is fast and reliable
- Perfect for baseline predictions
- Often just as accurate for short-term forecasts
- No complex dependencies

## âœ… Verify Installation

Test if everything works:
```bash
python -c "import streamlit, pandas, numpy, plotly, sklearn; print('âœ… SUCCESS!')"
```

If you see "âœ… SUCCESS!", you're ready to go!

## ðŸŽ‰ Ready to Use!

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

Then:
1. Load "Natural Gas" sample
2. Generate forecast with "Simple Moving Average"
3. Run valuation
4. Export results

**All features work! ðŸš€**
