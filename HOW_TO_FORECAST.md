# 📈 How to Use Forecasting - Step by Step

## ✅ Utility Detection is NOW WORKING!

The utility detection has been fixed! Natural Gas is now correctly identified as "Natural Gas" (not water).

## 🚀 How to Generate a Forecast (No Package Installation Needed!)

### Step 1: Load Sample Data
1. Go to http://localhost:8501
2. Click **"📊 Upload Data"** in the sidebar
3. Select **"Natural Gas"** from dropdown
4. Click **"Load Sample"** button
5. ✅ You'll see it correctly detected as "Natural Gas"!

### Step 2: Go to Forecast Page
1. Click **"📈 Forecast"** in the sidebar
2. You should see the forecast configuration page

### Step 3: Configure Forecast
1. **Forecast Horizon**: Set to **90** days
2. **Forecast Model**: Select **"Simple Moving Average"** (IMPORTANT!)
3. **Confidence Level**: Leave at 0.95 (95%)
4. **Test Set Size**: Leave at 20%

###  Step 4: Generate Forecast
1. Click the **"🚀 Generate Forecast"** button
2. Wait 2-3 seconds for processing
3. ✅ You should see the forecast results!

## ⚠️ Why You're Getting ARIMA Error

If you see this error:
```
❌ ARIMA model requires statsmodels and pmdarima packages.
Install with: pip install statsmodels pmdarima
```

**Reason**: You selected "ARIMA" model instead of "Simple Moving Average"

**Solution**: Select **"Simple Moving Average"** from the dropdown!

## 📊 What Each Model Requires

| Model | Packages Required | Works Now? |
|-------|------------------|------------|
| **Simple Moving Average** | ✅ None | ✅ YES - Use This! |
| ARIMA | ❌ statsmodels, pmdarima | ❌ No |
| Prophet | ❌ prophet | ❌ No |

## 💡 Simple Moving Average Works Great!

Don't worry about not having ARIMA or Prophet. Simple Moving Average:
- ✅ Works immediately (no installation)
- ✅ Fast computation
- ✅ Good accuracy for 30-90 day forecasts
- ✅ Perfect for testing the platform
- ✅ Includes confidence intervals
- ✅ Shows trend component

## ❌ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "ARIMA model requires statsmodels"
**Solution**: Select "Simple Moving Average" instead of ARIMA

### Issue 2: "Prophet model requires prophet package"
**Solution**: Select "Simple Moving Average" instead of Prophet

### Issue 3: "No data loaded"
**Solution**: Go back to Upload Data page and load a sample

### Issue 4: Forecast not generating
**Solution**:
1. Make sure data is loaded (check Upload Data page)
2. Use "Simple Moving Average" model
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try refreshing the page (F5)

## 🔧 If You Want to Install ARIMA/Prophet (Optional)

### To install ARIMA:
```bash
pip install --user statsmodels pmdarima

### To install Prophet:
```bash
pip install --user prophet
```

**Note**: These may take 5-10 minutes to install and might have Python 3.12 compatibility issues.
